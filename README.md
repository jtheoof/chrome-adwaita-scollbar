A simple Chrome extension to have nice Adwaita scrollbars matching GTK3 default
theme. This project was simply copied from the great work of Jamin Thornsberry
but was lacking the proper matching for the content script.

Unfortunately, I could not find the source code on github.

See the original theme here:
